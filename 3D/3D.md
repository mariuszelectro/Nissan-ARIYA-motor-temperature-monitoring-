### 3D Models (Source Files)

Here you will find the 3D models (source files) created in **FreeCAD**. The models are designed for 3D printing.

In the future, these models will be supplemented with `.stl` files.

You can open the `.FCStd` file in FreeCAD to make changes and export the models of individual components.
